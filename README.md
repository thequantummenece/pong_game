# Pong Game

## Description
This is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using the Turtle graphics library in Python. Pong is a two-player sports game that simulates table tennis. Players control paddles on either side of the screen, and they try to hit a ball back and forth.

## Features
- Two-player mode: Play against a friend.
- Simple controls: Use keyboard keys to move paddles up and down.
- Score tracking: Keep track of points for each player.
- Ball speed increase: The ball speeds up with each successful hit.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/thequantummenece/pong-game.git

    cd pong-game
    ```

3. Run the game.
    ```bash

4. Use the following controls:
    - Player 1: `e` to move up, `x` to move down.
    - Player 2: `Up arrow` to move up, `Down arrow` to move down.

5. Enjoy the game!
